# TodaiNote
todai is a goal/subtask, and to-do maneger to help manage and track to-do's and goal tracking to keep mind clear and focus where it need to be for reiteration of prompts my goal is to make a goal, to-do, prompt based system to help focus on what matters and when i have it funtioning i will fully intergrate ai to help organise my time and focus, i will either intergrate my prompt library or make two apps that compliment each other 

V0.1 fucntions: |-add goals
                |-add subgoals
                |-add to-do's
                (tbc)
                    |-edit goal's
                    |-edit/ complete subgoals
                    |-timer for alert for to-do's
                    |-mark commplete to-do's
                    |-edit function
                    |-return(back) to make navigating app easier
constintly reiterating and using app will allow you to understand what it needs aswell as updating read me to keep task updated and managable 
(**goals**)
for V0.2
    |-ai intergration
    |-prompt library 
    |-improved ui/ ux
    |-extend to app and beyond


general note's: essentially try replace my obsidian, atleast by personalising it it will make it more emotionally charged make it like a spell book, a grimoir obsidian is great and i dont expect to fully replace but my own spin will be cool 
keep making apps and practicing ai coding learn agentic control
gamification baby
add copy function
keep reiterating through ai to keep learning and keep data structures intact and help me learn good practices and productivity
