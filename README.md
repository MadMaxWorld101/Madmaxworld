# TodaiNote  

**TodaiNote** is a goal, subtask, and to-do manager designed to track tasks efficiently, keeping the mind clear and focused.  
The goal is to develop a **goal, to-do, and prompt-based system** to optimize focus and time management.  

ðŸš€ **Future Plans:**  
Once the core functionality is stable, **AI integration** will enhance organization and decision-making.  
The system may also evolve into a **companion app** for managing a personalized **prompt library**.
