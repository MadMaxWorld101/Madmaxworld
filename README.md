AI Assistant Development

Phase 1: Coding Assistant

Introduce a single AI assistant for coding-related tasks.

Basic structure stored in assistant.json with attributes:
________________
----------------
{
  "assistants": {
    "Coding Assistant": {
      "description": "Helps with programming tasks, debugging, and explanations.",
      "tasks": ["Code review", "Debugging", "Syntax help"]
    }
  }
}
________________
----------------

Phase 2: Pydantic Integration

Validate assistant data before loading.

Introduce structured models with pydantic for cleaner data management.
________________
----------------

Phase 3: Multi-Agent Expansion

Expand assistant capabilities (e.g., writing, productivity, research assistants).

Allow interaction between different AI agents for collaboration.

Store agent knowledge and tasks dynamically.

ðŸ“Œ Notes & Future Ideas

Gamification

Progress Tracking: Visual progress bars, streaks, or rewards for achieving goals.

Motivation Boosters: Gamify task management to boost user engagement and consistency.

Leveling Up: Unlock special features or content based on progress to keep users motivated.


AI Assistance

Automated Task Prioritization: Use AI to analyze past tasks and suggest the best order to tackle current goals and subtasks.

Prompt Refinement: AI-powered suggestions for improving and automating task and goal prompts.

Behavioral Tracking: AI detects user patterns (e.g., hyper-focus on certain tasks) and suggests adjustments to keep the user on track.

Personalization & Workflow Improvement

Grimoire/Spell Book Concept: A tool that replaces Obsidian for personal organization, where users store and manage goals, tasks, and prompts.

Task Duplication: Quickly duplicate tasks for repetitive goals (e.g., daily habits, recurring deadlines).

Dynamic Prompt Library: Continuously expand and refine the prompt library, utilizing AI to optimize workflows.

Iterative Development

Refinement: Focus on refining the app's core features, improving data structures, and ensuring scalability.

User Feedback: Incorporate feedback from users (even if it's just yourself initially) to enhance features and usability.
