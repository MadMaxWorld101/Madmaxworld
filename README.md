# **TodaiNote**  

**TodaiNote** is a goal, subtask, and to-do manager designed to track tasks efficiently, keeping your mind clear and focused.  
The goal is to develop a **goal, to-do, and prompt-based system** that helps optimize focus and time management.  

🚀 **Future Plans:**  
Once the core functionality is stable, **AI integration** will enhance organization and decision-making.  
The system will evolve into a **companion app** for managing a personalized **prompt library**.
